"""
Problem:

    A popular gameshow has a words round where contestants are required to guess at
    a word when it is written without any vowels in it.  For example, a clue might
    be "bldng" and the answer would be "building".

    The function 'clue' should take a word, and print out the corresponding clue
    for that word - the word minus any vowels.


Tests:

    >>> clue("building")
    bldng
    >>> clue("atmosphere")
    tmsphr
    >>> clue("perpendicular")
    prpndclr
    >>> clue("recipe")
    rcp
