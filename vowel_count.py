Problem:

    We need to count the number of vowels present in a string.
    The function `vowels` should take a string and print out
    the number of vowels it contains.

Tests:

    >>> vowels("hello")
    2
    >>> vowels("world")
    1
    >>> vowels("why")
    0
    >>> vowels("beautiful")
    5
